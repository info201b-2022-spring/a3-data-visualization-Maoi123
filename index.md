# Assignment 3: Incarceration
In this assignment, you'll create the necessary files to perform the analysis described on Canvas (including `analysis.R`, `index.Rmd`, and by _knitting_ your document, an `index.html` file). 

Once you have completed your report, make sure to **change your repository settings** so that you can view the hosted website (which will be available at https://ORGANIZATION_NAME.github.io/REPO_NAME)

#Introduction
In this incarceration data, I choose 8 variables to analyze. They are "year", and the jail population from total and different races, such as "total jail population", "Jail Population Count, Asian American / Pacific Islander", "Jail Population Count, Black", "Jail Population Count, Latinx", "Jail Population Count, Native American", "Jail Population Count, White", and "Unknown or Other Racial Category".
5 relevant values of interest are the following:
- the mean of each value in most recent year(2018): 248.944975   2.389794  83.602482 38.293354   3.483077 116.872256   1.291223
- the difference between the max and min mean number in different races: 247.6538
- the highest number of jail population in each race: 286.4  5024.0  8728.0   379.0  4577.0   608.0
- the lowest number of jail population in each race: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
- number of people are incarcerated in different racial groups in different years: from this table, we could see the change of jail population in different racial groups within the years.

#Trends over time chart
The chart I made shows the jail population in different races increased with time. I created this graph to demonstrate how much and how quickly the jail population grows in different races in comparison. This will be more visually appealing. According to the graph, the total jail population increased significantly between 1995 and 2000, with the white population increasing the most, followed by the black and latinx populations.

#Variable comparison chart
This graph depicts the relationship between the black and total prison populations. I included this chart to see if the increasing jail population in black is related to the overall increasing population. According to the graph, as the total jail population increased, so did the black jail population. As a result, they have a positive relationship.

#Map
In this project, two maps were created. These two charts were included because they show the jail population in the mainland United States for white and black people separately. We can see from the maps that the density of both white and black jail populations is fairly consistent across the country. The north of the country appears to have a larger jail population than the south of the country in general.
